#This Repository is part of the Smart-Building project
The Smart-Building project is a system to recognise the
owner/occupier of a building via face and voice recognition
allowing the unlocking of a door and the overiding of the
lighting and heating systems.

Files here are specific to the Raspberry Pi
A bash script is included to be pulled down to a rpi
This script starts by apt-get update & apt-get upgrade
then installing dependencies for node-red, before installing
dependencies to allow the instalation of openCV
